                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            Computer security, or more formally known as IT security, is defined as 'the protection
                            of computer systems from the theft and damage to their hardware, software or information, 
                            as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide'.<sup><a href="#cite1">[1]</a></sup>
                            Thus, protection includes the physical and software side. Security is a growing field of interest and
                            importance because we are relying more and more on these devices. These devices are connected to the 
                            Internet, and that brings a lot of trouble with it. In the next section we will discuss some common 
                            modern attacks.

                        <p>There are several kinds of security attacks, examples that we will discuss briefly:</p>

                        <h4>Denial-of-service attack</h4>
                        <p>
                            Denial of service attacks (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable 
                            to its intended users. Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by 
                            entering a wrong password enough times to cause the victims account to 
                            be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users 
                            at once. This is an annoying type of attack. Even though a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked with
                            the firewall, many forms of Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are possible. As a result, the 
                            attack comes in an overload and defending against it is much more difficult.<sup><a href="#cite2">[2]</a></sup>

                        <h4>Phishing</h4>
                        <p>
                            Phishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive information. This could be your usernames, passwords &and; credit card data
                            It happens often when you think you are visiting a legitimate website (say, your bank website) and try to login. Hence the
                            word 'Phishing' - using a bait (website) to try to catch a victim (user filling in his/hers sensitive information). 
                            Phishing is typically done in combination with <a href="#spoofing">spoofing</a>.<sup><a href="#cite4">[4]</a></sup> You could recognize phishing by the
                            URL that you are visiting. The fake websites cannot fake the URL as if it resembled the legitimate website.
                            Phishing exploits the weaknesses of the web security and is a technique of what we call 'Social engineering'.<sup><a href="#cite5">[5]</a></sup>

                        <h4>SQL Injection</h4>
                        <p>
                            SQL Injection is one of - or maybe the most - common technique for web hacking. It is based on providing 'unusual' input for the input fields, e.g. username and 
                            password. The input could be for example the following string: ' OR '1'='1. This results in <em>true</em> and gives the 
                            necessary information to the hacker.<sup><a href="#cite6">[6]</a></sup> See the picture below for a clear schema of this type of attack.<sup><a href="#cite7">[7]</a></sup>

                        <h4>Malware</h4>
                        <p>
                            Malware stands for malicious software. This subject is so wide, you could fill books with it. We won't go that far. Malware can be viruses, ransomware, trojan horses, worms
                            and more. The basic functionality of malware is that it takes the form of executable code. It is deliberately going against the flow of a computer - and requirements of the user
                            behind it.
