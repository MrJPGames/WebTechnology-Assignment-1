                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            Computer security, or more formally known as IT security, is defined as 'the protection
                            of computer systems from the theft and damage to their hardware, software or information, 
                            as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide'.<sup><a href="#cite1">[1]</a></sup>
                            Thus, protection includes the physical and software side. Security is a growing field of interest and
                            importance because we are relying more and more on these devices. These devices are connected to the 
                            Internet, and that brings a lot of trouble with it. In the next section we will discuss some common 
                            modern attacks.

                        <h3>Common attacks</h3>
                        <p>There are several kinds of security attacks, examples that we will discuss briefly:</p>

                        <h4>Denial-of-service attack</h4>
                        <p>
                            Denial of service attacks (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable 
                            to its intended users. Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by 
                            entering a wrong password enough times to cause the victims account to 
                            be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users 
                            at once. This is an annoying type of attack. Even though a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked with
                            the firewall, many forms of Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are possible. Here, the 
                            attack comes in an overload and defending against it is much more difficult. <sup><a href="#cite2">[2]</a></sup>
